# Consensus Algorithms/Protocols

"Consensus" refers to a general agreement or a collective opinion among a group of individuals. It's a process of decision-making that seeks to achieve broad acceptance or agreement among members of a group, rather than enforcing a single dominant opinion. In a consensus approach, the members of the group work together to find a solution that is acceptable to everyone involved. This process often involves discussions, negotiations, and compromises to address the concerns and opinions of all members.

Consensus is important in various settings, including business, politics, and social groups, as it helps to ensure that decisions are made in a collaborative and inclusive manner. The aim is not necessarily for everyone to completely agree with the final decision, but rather for all participants to accept it as a reasonable outcome.
